# Timeseries Data Reader Project

This project is a Python utility application for reading pre-recorded timeseries data to provide "dummy" data input to data acquisition systems in development.

## Project Structure
- Using Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach
- Python with pytest for testing
- Support for CSV and JSON timeseries data formats
- Socket programming integration for data transmission

## TDD Workflow
1. Write failing tests first (Red)
2. Write minimal code to make tests pass (Green)
3. Refactor and improve the code (Refactor)

## Development Guidelines
- Follow TDD principles strictly
- Write clear, descriptive test names
- Keep functions small and focused
- Use proper error handling for file operations
- Document socket communication protocols
